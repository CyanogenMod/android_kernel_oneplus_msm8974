Up to version 0.5, nothing interesting. Small cosmetic issues resulting
in exactly the same.

Oct 15 2003: Version 0.6:
Made the Makefile for 2.4 and 2.2 work properly, using the original Rules.make

Apr 6 2004: Version 0.7:
Added the "economic" device /dev/erandom, which seeds new files from its own
RC4-like random numbers. Weaker randomness, no entropy used at all.

Apr 18 2004: Version 0.8

Created a patch version for application on the kernel source tree.

Added interface for sysctl in the patch version.

export-objs line added in makefile to allow the export of
erandom_get_random_bytes

The global random state (for erandom) is now seeded only at first read
request, and not on module initialization, or in other words, as late
as possible. This makes sense when the module is compiled into the kernel,
and hence initialized before the boot startup scripts seeds the regular
random generator, from which the initial seed is taken.

Jan 6 2007: Version 1.0 : Fixes against 2.6.19
Replaced deprecated MODULE_PARM with module_param for compilation of 2.6.0 kernels
and up.

Replaced kdev_t related and deprecated MINOR macro with iminor(inode) for 2.6.0
and up.

Also removed include of config.h for 2.6.0 and up

Moved the symlink of Makefile from Makefile-2.4 to Makefile-2.6 (it's about time).

Jul 28 2011: Version 1.1 : Sync with 2.6.37

Removed any support for kernels prior to 2.6.

Changed the init and release methods to behave correctly with udev, and
added a udev rule to match frandom/erandom devices.

Updated sysctl interface to match current API

Updated INSTALL file to reflect the new installation.

Removed sysctl interface (since there's no use for it anymore)
