config NO_HZ
	bool "Tickless System (Dynamic Ticks)"
	depends on !ARCH_USES_GETTIMEOFFSET && GENERIC_CLOCKEVENTS
	select NO_HZ_COMMON
	help
	  This option enables a tickless system: timer interrupts will
	  only trigger on an as-needed basis both when the system is
	  busy and when the system is idle.

config NO_HZ_FULL
	bool "Full dynticks system (tickless single task)"
	# NO_HZ_COMMON dependency
	depends on !ARCH_USES_GETTIMEOFFSET && GENERIC_CLOCKEVENTS
	# RCU_USER_QS

	select IRQ_WORK
	help
	 Adaptively try to shutdown the tick whenever possible, even when
	 the CPU is running tasks. Typically this requires running a single
	 task on the CPU. Chances for running tickless are maximized when
	 the task mostly runs in userspace and has few kernel activity.

	 You need to fill up the nohz_full boot parameter with the
	 desired range of dynticks CPUs.

	 This is implemented at the expense of some overhead in user <-> kernel
	 transitions: syscalls, exceptions and interrupts. Even when it's
	 dynamically off.

	 Say N.

config HIGH_RES_TIMERS
	bool "High Resolution Timer Support"
	depends on !ARCH_USES_GETTIMEOFFSET && GENERIC_CLOCKEVENTS
	select TICK_ONESHOT
	help
	  This option enables high resolution timer support. If your
	  hardware is not capable then this option only increases
	  the size of the kernel image.

	default y
	depends on GENERIC_CLOCKEVENTS
