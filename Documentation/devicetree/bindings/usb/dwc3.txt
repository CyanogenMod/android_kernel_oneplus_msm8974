DWC3- USB3 CONTROLLER

Required properties:
 - compatible: must be "synopsys,dwc3"
 - reg : Address and length of the register set for the device
 - interrupts: Interrupts used by the dwc3 controller.
 - interrupt-names : Required interrupt resource entries are:
	"irq" : Interrupt for DWC3 core
	"otg_irq" : Interrupt for DWC3 core's OTG Events

Optional properties:
 - tx-fifo-resize: determines if the FIFO *has* to be reallocated.
 - host-only-mode: if present then dwc3 should be run in HOST only mode.
 - snps,hsphy-auto-suspend-disable: If present, auto suspend feature is not enabled with hsusb phy.
 - snps,ssphy-clear-auto-suspend-on-disconnect: If present, clear auto suspend feaure with ssusb phy
   during cable disconnect.
 - snps,usb3-u1u2-disable: If present, disable u1u2 low power modes for DWC3 core controller in SS mode.

This is usually a subnode to DWC3 glue to which it is connected.
