/**
 * DOC: Introduction
 *
 * cfg80211 is the configuration API for 802.11 devices in Linux. It bridges
 * userspace and drivers, and offers some utility functionality associated
 * with 802.11. cfg80211 must, directly or indirectly via mac80211, be used
 * by all modern wireless drivers in Linux, so that they offer a consistent
 * API through nl80211. For backward compatibility, cfg80211 also offers
 * wireless extensions to userspace, but hides them from drivers completely.
 *
 * Additionally, cfg80211 contains code to help enforce regulatory spectrum
 * use restrictions.
 */


/**
 * DOC: Device registration
 *
 * In order for a driver to use cfg80211, it must register the hardware device
 * with cfg80211. This happens through a number of hardware capability structs
 * described below.
 *
 * The fundamental structure for each device is the 'wiphy', of which each
 * instance describes a physical wireless device connected to the system. Each
 * such wiphy can have zero, one, or many virtual interfaces associated with
 * it, which need to be identified as such by pointing the network interface's
 * @ieee80211_ptr pointer to a &struct wireless_dev which further describes
 * the wireless part of the interface, normally this struct is embedded in the
 * network interface's private data area. Drivers can optionally allow creating
 * or destroying virtual interfaces on the fly, but without at least one or the
 * ability to create some the wireless device isn't useful.
 *
 * Each wiphy structure contains device capability information, and also has
 * a pointer to the various operations the driver offers. The definitions and
 * structures here describe these capabilities in detail.

 * DOC: Scanning and BSS list handling
 *
 * The scanning process itself is fairly simple, but cfg80211 offers quite
 * a bit of helper functionality. To start a scan, the scan operation will
 * be invoked with a scan definition. This scan definition contains the
 * channels to scan, and the SSIDs to send probe requests for (including the
 * wildcard, if desired). A passive scan is indicated by having no SSIDs to
 * probe. Additionally, a scan request may contain extra information elements
 * that should be added to the probe request. The IEs are guaranteed to be
 * well-formed, and will not exceed the maximum length the driver advertised
 * in the wiphy structure.
 *
 * When scanning finds a BSS, cfg80211 needs to be notified of that, because
 * it is responsible for maintaining the BSS list; the driver should not
 * maintain a list itself. For this notification, various functions exist.
 *
 * Since drivers do not maintain a BSS list, there are also a number of
 * functions to search for a BSS and obtain information about it from the
 * BSS structure cfg80211 maintains. The BSS list is also made available
 * to userspace.

/**
 * struct cfg80211_ops - backend description for wireless configuration
 *
 * This struct is registered by fullmac card drivers and/or wireless stacks
 * in order to handle configuration requests on their interfaces.
 *
 * All callbacks except where otherwise noted should return 0
 * on success or a negative error code.
 *
 * All operations are currently invoked under rtnl for consistency with the
 * wireless extensions but this is subject to reevaluation as soon as this
 * code is used more widely and we have a first user without wext.
 *
 * @suspend: wiphy device needs to be suspended. The variable @wow will
 *	be %NULL or contain the enabled Wake-on-Wireless triggers that are
 *	configured for the device.
 * @resume: wiphy device needs to be resumed
 *
 * @add_virtual_intf: create a new virtual interface with the given name,
 *	must set the struct wireless_dev's iftype. Beware: You must create
 *	the new netdev in the wiphy's network namespace! Returns the netdev,
 *	or an ERR_PTR.
 *
 * @del_virtual_intf: remove the virtual interface determined by ifindex.
 *
 * @change_virtual_intf: change type/configuration of virtual interface,
 *	keep the struct wireless_dev's iftype updated.
 *
 * @add_key: add a key with the given parameters. @mac_addr will be %NULL
 *	when adding a group key.
 *
 * @get_key: get information about the key with the given parameters.
 *	@mac_addr will be %NULL when requesting information for a group
 *	key. All pointers given to the @callback function need not be valid
 *	after it returns. This function should return an error if it is
 *	not possible to retrieve the key, -ENOENT if it doesn't exist.
 *
 * @del_key: remove a key given the @mac_addr (%NULL for a group key)
 *	and @key_index, return -ENOENT if the key doesn't exist.
 *
 * @set_default_key: set the default key on an interface
 *
 * @set_default_mgmt_key: set the default management frame key on an interface
 *
 * @set_rekey_data: give the data necessary for GTK rekeying to the driver
 *
 * @start_ap: Start acting in AP mode defined by the parameters.
 * @change_beacon: Change the beacon parameters for an access point mode
 *	interface. This should reject the call when AP mode wasn't started.
 * @stop_ap: Stop being an AP, including stopping beaconing.
 *
 * @add_station: Add a new station.
 * @del_station: Remove a station; @mac may be NULL to remove all stations.
 * @change_station: Modify a given station. Note that flags changes are not much
 *	validated in cfg80211, in particular the auth/assoc/authorized flags
 *	might come to the driver in invalid combinations -- make sure to check
 *	them, also against the existing state! Also, supported_rates changes are
 *	not checked in station mode -- drivers need to reject (or ignore) them
 *	for anything but TDLS peers.
 * @get_station: get station information for the station identified by @mac
 * @dump_station: dump station callback -- resume dump at index @idx
 *
 * @add_mpath: add a fixed mesh path
 * @del_mpath: delete a given mesh path
 * @change_mpath: change a given mesh path
 * @get_mpath: get a mesh path for the given parameters
 * @dump_mpath: dump mesh path callback -- resume dump at index @idx
 * @join_mesh: join the mesh network with the specified parameters
 * @leave_mesh: leave the current mesh network
 *
 * @get_mesh_config: Get the current mesh configuration
 *
 * @update_mesh_config: Update mesh parameters on a running mesh.
 *	The mask is a bitfield which tells us which parameters to
 *	set, and which to leave alone.
 *
 * @change_bss: Modify parameters for a given BSS.
 *
 * @set_txq_params: Set TX queue parameters
 *
 * @set_channel: Set channel for a given wireless interface. Some devices
 *	may support multi-channel operation (by channel hopping) so cfg80211
 *	doesn't verify much. Note, however, that the passed netdev may be
 *	%NULL as well if the user requested changing the channel for the
 *	device itself, or for a monitor interface.
 * @get_channel: Get the current operating channel, should return %NULL if
 *	there's no single defined operating channel if for example the
 *	device implements channel hopping for multi-channel virtual interfaces.
 *
 * @scan: Request to do a scan. If returning zero, the scan request is given
 *	the driver, and will be valid until passed to cfg80211_scan_done().
 *	For scan results, call cfg80211_inform_bss(); you can call this outside
 *	the scan/scan_done bracket too.
 *
 * @auth: Request to authenticate with the specified peer
 * @assoc: Request to (re)associate with the specified peer
 * @deauth: Request to deauthenticate from the specified peer
 * @disassoc: Request to disassociate from the specified peer
 *
 * @connect: Connect to the ESS with the specified parameters. When connected,
 *	call cfg80211_connect_result() with status code %WLAN_STATUS_SUCCESS.
 *	If the connection fails for some reason, call cfg80211_connect_result()
 *	with the status from the AP.
 * @disconnect: Disconnect from the BSS/ESS.
 *
 * @join_ibss: Join the specified IBSS (or create if necessary). Once done, call
 *	cfg80211_ibss_joined(), also call that function when changing BSSID due
 *	to a merge.
 * @leave_ibss: Leave the IBSS.
 *
 * @set_wiphy_params: Notify that wiphy parameters have changed;
 *	@changed bitfield (see &enum wiphy_params_flags) describes which values
 *	have changed. The actual parameter values are available in
 *	struct wiphy. If returning an error, no value should be changed.
 *
 * @set_tx_power: set the transmit power according to the parameters,
 *	the power passed is in mBm, to get dBm use MBM_TO_DBM().
 * @get_tx_power: store the current TX power into the dbm variable;
 *	return 0 if successful
 *
 * @set_wds_peer: set the WDS peer for a WDS interface
 *
 * @rfkill_poll: polls the hw rfkill line, use cfg80211 reporting
 *	functions to adjust rfkill hw state
 *
 * @dump_survey: get site survey information.
 *
 * @remain_on_channel: Request the driver to remain awake on the specified
 *	channel for the specified duration to complete an off-channel
 *	operation (e.g., public action frame exchange). When the driver is
 *	ready on the requested channel, it must indicate this with an event
 *	notification by calling cfg80211_ready_on_channel().
 * @cancel_remain_on_channel: Cancel an on-going remain-on-channel operation.
 *	This allows the operation to be terminated prior to timeout based on
 *	the duration value.
 * @mgmt_tx: Transmit a management frame.
 * @mgmt_tx_cancel_wait: Cancel the wait time from transmitting a management
 *	frame on another channel
 *
 * @testmode_cmd: run a test mode command
 * @testmode_dump: Implement a test mode dump. The cb->args[2] and up may be
 *	used by the function, but 0 and 1 must not be touched. Additionally,
 *	return error codes other than -ENOBUFS and -ENOENT will terminate the
 *	dump and return to userspace with an error, so be careful. If any data
 *	was passed in from userspace then the data/len arguments will be present
 *	and point to the data contained in %NL80211_ATTR_TESTDATA.
 *
 * @set_bitrate_mask: set the bitrate mask configuration
 *
 * @set_pmksa: Cache a PMKID for a BSSID. This is mostly useful for fullmac
 *	devices running firmwares capable of generating the (re) association
 *	RSN IE. It allows for faster roaming between WPA2 BSSIDs.
 * @del_pmksa: Delete a cached PMKID.
 * @flush_pmksa: Flush all cached PMKIDs.
 * @set_power_mgmt: Configure WLAN power management. A timeout value of -1
 *	allows the driver to adjust the dynamic ps timeout value.
 * @set_cqm_rssi_config: Configure connection quality monitor RSSI threshold.
 * @sched_scan_start: Tell the driver to start a scheduled scan.
 * @sched_scan_stop: Tell the driver to stop an ongoing scheduled
 *	scan.  The driver_initiated flag specifies whether the driver
 *	itself has informed that the scan has stopped.
 *
 * @mgmt_frame_register: Notify driver that a management frame type was
 *	registered. Note that this callback may not sleep, and cannot run
 *	concurrently with itself.
 *
 * @set_antenna: Set antenna configuration (tx_ant, rx_ant) on the device.
 *	Parameters are bitmaps of allowed antennas to use for TX/RX. Drivers may
 *	reject TX/RX mask combinations they cannot support by returning -EINVAL
 *	(also see nl80211.h @NL80211_ATTR_WIPHY_ANTENNA_TX).
 *
 * @get_antenna: Get current antenna configuration from device (tx_ant, rx_ant).
 *
 * @set_ringparam: Set tx and rx ring sizes.
 *
 * @get_ringparam: Get tx and rx ring current and maximum sizes.
 *
 * @tdls_mgmt: Transmit a TDLS management frame.
 * @tdls_oper: Perform a high-level TDLS operation (e.g. TDLS link setup).
 *
 * @probe_client: probe an associated client, must return a cookie that it
 *	later passes to cfg80211_probe_status().
 *
 * @set_noack_map: Set the NoAck Map for the TIDs.
 * @set_mac_acl: Sets MAC address control list in AP and P2P GO mode.
 *	Parameters include ACL policy, an array of MAC address of stations
 *	and the number of MAC addresses. If there is already a list in driver
 *	this new list replaces the existing one. Driver has to clear its ACL
 *	when number of MAC addresses entries is passed as 0. Drivers which
 *	advertise the support for MAC based ACL have to implement this callback.
 *
 * @set_qos_map: Set QoS mapping information to the driver

 * @WIPHY_FLAG_CUSTOM_REGULATORY:  tells us the driver for this device

 *	ISO / IEC 3166 alpha2 it belongs to. When this is enabled
 *	we will disregard the first regulatory hint (when the
 *	initiator is %REGDOM_SET_BY_CORE). wiphys can set the custom
 *	regulatory domain using wiphy_apply_custom_regulatory()
 *	prior to wiphy registration.
 * @WIPHY_FLAG_STRICT_REGULATORY: tells us that the wiphy for this device
 *	has regulatory domain that it wishes to be considered as the
 *	superset for regulatory rules. After this device gets its regulatory
 *	domain programmed further regulatory hints shall only be considered
 *	for this device to enhance regulatory compliance, forcing the
 *	device to only possibly use subsets of the original regulatory
 *	rules. For example if channel 13 and 14 are disabled by this
 *	device's regulatory domain no user specified regulatory hint which
 *	has these channels enabled would enable them for this wiphy,
 *	the device's original regulatory domain will be trusted as the
 *	base. You can program the superset of regulatory rules for this

 *	until their own regulatory domain gets programmed.
 * @WIPHY_FLAG_DISABLE_BEACON_HINTS: enable this if your driver needs to ensure
 *	that passive scan flags and beaconing flags may not be lifted by
 *	cfg80211 due to regulatory beacon hints. For more information on beacon

 * @WIPHY_FLAG_NETNS_OK: if not set, do not allow changing the netns of this
 *	wiphy at all
 * @WIPHY_FLAG_ENFORCE_COMBINATIONS: Set this flag to enforce interface
 *	combinations for this device. This flag is used for backward
 *	compatibility only until all drivers advertise combinations and
 *	they will always be enforced.
 * @WIPHY_FLAG_PS_ON_BY_DEFAULT: if set to true, powersave will be enabled
 *	by default -- this flag will be set depending on the kernel's default
 *	on wiphy_new(), but can be changed by the driver if it has a good
 *	reason to override the default
 * @WIPHY_FLAG_4ADDR_AP: supports 4addr mode even on AP (with a single station

 * @WIPHY_FLAG_4ADDR_STATION: supports 4addr mode even as a station

 * @WIPHY_FLAG_MESH_AUTH: The device supports mesh authentication by routing
 *	auth frames to userspace. See @NL80211_MESH_SETUP_USERSPACE_AUTH.
 * @WIPHY_FLAG_SUPPORTS_SCHED_SCAN: The device supports scheduled scans.
 * @WIPHY_FLAG_SUPPORTS_FW_ROAM: The device supports roaming feature in the
 *	firmware.
 * @WIPHY_FLAG_AP_UAPSD: The device supports uapsd on AP.
 * @WIPHY_FLAG_SUPPORTS_TDLS: The device supports TDLS (802.11z) operation.
 * @WIPHY_FLAG_TDLS_EXTERNAL_SETUP: The device does not handle TDLS (802.11z)
 *	link setup/discovery operations internally. Setup, discovery and
 *	teardown packets should be sent through the @NL80211_CMD_TDLS_MGMT
 *	command. When this flag is not set, @NL80211_CMD_TDLS_OPER should be
 *	used for asking the driver/firmware to perform a TDLS operation.
 * @WIPHY_FLAG_HAVE_AP_SME: device integrates AP SME
 * @WIPHY_FLAG_REPORTS_OBSS: the device will report beacons from other BSSes
 *	when there are virtual interfaces in AP mode by calling
